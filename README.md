This is a collection of my own Python solutions to Project Euler problems: https://projecteuler.net/archive

In some solutions, I add extra things, such as user input, etc.

**This is intended for evaluation of my coding and math skills ONLY**

**IMPORTANT:** *Please do not look at the scripts if you're planning on going through the Project Euler yourself, except for the problems already solved by you.*
