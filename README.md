This is a collection of my own Python solutions to Project Euler problems: https://projecteuler.net/archives

**This is intended for future employers' evaluation of my coding and math skills ONLY**

**IMPORTANT:** *Please do not look at the scripts if you're planning on going through the Project Euler yourself, except for the problems already solved by you.*
